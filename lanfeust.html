        <h1 id="chapitre">Synopsis</h1>
        <p >On the world of Troy, most humans have a single magic power. Each power is unique to the
            person
            and includes such diverse feats as walking on water, personal teleportation, and causing thirst in others.
            However, none can use their power unless in the close or remote presence of a sage of Eckmül, Troy's version
            of a studied magician.
        </p>
        <p >Lanfeust is an orphan and an apprentice blacksmith who can heat metal at will. His adventure
            begins when he is asked to mend the sword of a passing aristocrat. When handling the sword's pommel, which
            was made of ivory from the Magohamoth—a legendary magical beast—Lanfeust gains the power to use any power
            known in Troy, more so without the presence of a sage. Nicolede, both the local sage and Lanfeust's future
            father-in-law, persuades Lanfeust to accompany him and his daughters C'ian and Cixi to the University of
            Magic in Eckmül in order to learn more about this phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p >Among the many perils faced during their journey, they are ultimately confronted by Thanos,
            a
            pirate with the same potential as Lanfeust who will do whatever it takes to steal the ivory of the
            Magohamoth.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2 id="chapitre">Main characters</h2>
        <h3>Lanfeust</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/lanfeust_character.jpg" alt="lanfeust_character">
        <p>
            Lanfeust, the eponymous hero, is a young villager and apprentice blacksmith. He was planning on settling
            down
            with
            his fiancée, C'ian, and leading a quiet, peaceful life until he discovered the power that the Magohamoth's
            ivory
            bestowed upon him. Though brave enough from the beginning to face extreme danger, Lanfeust remains
            happy-go-lucky
            and demonstrates naïveté in many matters of life and love.
        </p>
        <p>
            His original power allows him to heat and even melt metal at will, a handy trick that led him into
            blacksmithing.
            However, his true power arises when he possesses the Magohamoth's ivory. It technically allows him to use
            any
            magic</p>
        <p> power that has ever existed, but in practice it allows Lanfeust to accomplish almost any magical feat he can
            imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lanfeust's name comes from the common Breton place name.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Thanos</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/thanos_character.jpg" alt="thanos_character">
        <p> A renegade sage from Eckmül's University of Magic, Thanos is also an accomplished pirate and, unknown to
            many,the tyrannical baron Averroës. Like Lanfeust, when possessing Magohamoth ivory, Thanos becomes almost
            omnipotent,
            though</p>
        <p>he would use these powers to conquer Eckmül and probably the whole world. Intelligent, opportunistic, and
            ruthless. Thanos commands the respect and fear of his followers even without his absolute magical power.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a former sage of Eckmül, Thanos knows many useful spells and rituals. Unlike other sages, Thanos never
            gave
            up his original magic power, which allows him to teleport anywhere he's ever been. However, teleporting
            strips
            him
            of mall his possessions, even his clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanos's name is a shortened form of the root word thanatos, the Greek word for death. Prepending an a turns
            the
            word into its opposite, athanatos, which would mean immortal. Both forms have been used as given names.
        </p>

        <h3>Nicolède</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/nicolede_character.jpg" alt=">nicolède_character">
        <p> Nicolède serves as the village of Glinin's sage. Like Thanos, Nicolede knows many spells and allows his
            fellow
            villagers to use their powers through his mere presence. He's also the village's main source of knowledge on
            the
            greater world. Kind and wise, Nicolède serves as a mentor for Lanfeust, his future son-in-law, as well as
            his
            daughters C'ian and Cixi. He has little patience for weak morals, which constantly puts him at odds with
            Cixi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicolede's name refers to Nicolas Flamel (an alchemist) and Archimedes (the ancient engineer).
        </p>

        <h3>C'ian</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/c'ian_character.jpg" alt="c'ian_character">
        <p> Nicolede's elder daughter, C'ian is Lanfeust's fiancée and Glinin's resident healer. Though extremely
            beautiful,
            C'ian is modest, romantic, and wants nothing more than a quiet life with a husband and many children.
            C'ian's
            power
            only functions at night, but it allows her to instantly heal almost any injury or illness imaginable.
        </p>
        <p>
            C'ian's name refers to the Empress Dowager Ci'an, who was regarded as quiet and respectable unlike her
            co-ruler,
            Cixi. C'ian also refers to the color cyan, easily the most used color in her usual garb.
        </p>


        <h3>Cixi</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/cixi_character.jpg" alt="cixi_character">
        <p> Nicolede's younger daughter, Cixi is very beautiful like her sister, but major similarities end there. She
            is
            rebellious against father, society, and decency. She dresses and talks provocatively for her time and place.
            Infatuated with Lanfeust, she attempts to seduce him whenever she can despite reprovals and scoldings from
            her
            father and sister. Of all Troy's beings, Lanfeust seems to fear only Cixi and her advances. Cixi can change
            the
            phase of water at will. The difficulty of this feat increases greatly as the purity of the water decreases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cixi's name refers to the Empress Dowager Cixi, co-regent of China and infamous for her shameless acts.
        </p>

        <h3>Hébus</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/hebus_character.jpg" alt="hebus_character">
        <p> Just like most of his troll species, Hébus was an almost mindless menace to any living thing in his path
            until
            he fell under Nicolede's spell. Throughout Lanfeust's adventures, he serves as an excellent bodyguard for
            his
            companions/captors. When enchanted, Hébus demonstrates that he's fairly intelligent, witty, and friendly,
            though
            he's rowdy and retains many of a troll's rude behaviors. However, if Nicolede's enchantment lapses, Hébus
            instantly becomes as savage and murderous as he was originally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name Hébus is a pun when combined with the word troll (troll Hébus, which in French sounds like trolley
            bus).
        </p>

        <h3>Chevalier Or-Azur</h3>
        <img id="imgcharacter" src="assets/images/chevalier_or_azur_character.jpg" alt="chevalier_or_azur_character">
        <p>
            The Or-Azure knight is a knight from the baronies, a region where no one has powers.
            He lives in a castle by a lake reminiscent of Loch Ness. He's madly in love with C'ian, and he ends up
            Join Lanfeust's quest in "The Petaurs Hide to Die" to protect C'ian. But at the end
            of "The Fabulous Beast", he marries C'ian, and takes her to live with him in his castel, leaving Cixi and
            Lanfeust
            alone.</p>

        <h2 id="chapitre">The universe of Troy</h2>
        <h3>The naming of planet Troy</h3>

        <p> The French-speaking discoverers of Troy's planetary system decided on a whim to officially name each planet
            after its numeric position from its sun. One, two, and three in French are un, deux, and trois respectively.
            In
            French,
            Troy looks and sounds similar to trois, and so Troy gained its name because it was the third planet in its
            system.
            This pun is referred to in "Un, Deux, Troy", the title of volume 1 of Lanfeust of the Stars.
        </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <h3>Souardy</h3>
        <p>Along with its capital, Eckmül, Souardy resembles a fantastical version of medieval Europe. Virtually all its
            citizens have one magical talent which, more often than not, will determine the profession of the person.
            For
            example, Lanfeust's talent to heat metal without a forge naturally steered him towards the life of a
            blacksmith.
        </p>
        <h3>Darshan</h3>
        <p>Darshan resembles imperial China and feudal Japan. It lies across the sea from Souardy. Darshanides do not
            have
            any
            magical talents, though their hypothetical latent power instead may give form to their collective gods.
        </p>
        <h3>The Baronies</h3>
        <p>The Baronies also resemble medieval Europe. Its fractious barons forever compete with each other for land and
            power.
            The people of the Baronies resent magic and forego its practice while focusing on martial talent instead.
